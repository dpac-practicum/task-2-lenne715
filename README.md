# ping-log
Monitoring the status of a business-critical server is an important task in any company. 

Write a script that will ping a server (35.192.3.38) every thirty minutes, note if it's up or down, then output that status to a file. You may use any language/tool of your choice. Create a README.md file in your repo describing how to execute your script, if other tools are necessary.
